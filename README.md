# Predicting Organic Farm Yield Based on Pesticides Use

## Objective
Build a simple Linear Regression model to predict organic farm yield based on the amount of pesticides used.

## Dataset
The dataset includes the following columns:
- `Value`: The amount of pesticides used (in units)
- Artificial `Yield`: Created for demonstration purposes.

## Implementation
The project follows these steps:
1. Load the dataset.
2. Preprocess the data (if necessary).
3. Create an artificial 'Yield' column.
4. Implement Linear Regression using `scikit-learn`.
5. Train and evaluate the model.
6. Visualize the regression line on a scatter plot.

## Running the Code
1. Ensure you have the required packages installed:
   ```sh
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
